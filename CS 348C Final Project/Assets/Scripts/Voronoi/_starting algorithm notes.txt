Sweep line:
Moves downwards (-y)

Beach line: set of parabolic arcs
Site is equadistant to parabolic arc near it and the sweep line (creates parabola shape)
When two sites are equidistant to the same parabola it creates a Voronoi vertex and traces
a Voronoi cell edge

Circle event: Empty circle (contains no sites) and touches 3+ sites on border, removes an arc
Represented by lowest point touching 3+ sites (may be false and removed later)
Site event: Sweep line encounters new site point, new arc breaks original in two 
(inserts itself in middle)
Represented by site coords
Voronoi vertex: when two or more breakpoints meet/fuse

State datastructures:
Diagram state - 
doubly linked list of half-edge (each ei has pointer to cell table entry, start/end vertices of half-edge,
prev/next half-edges in CCW chain, twin half-edge (other direction) 
vertex table (each vi has pointers to half-edges),
cell table (each ci has pointers to half-edges)

Bi-directional half-edge  pointers from one voronoi vertex to another
Cells created by chain of CCW uni-directional half-edges

Beach line state - track breakpoints, track arcs on beach line
Sweep line state - pqueue sorting on decreasing y-coordinate

RB-Tree - nodes are breakpoint site pairs, leafs are arcs (by site generated) with pointer to potential
circle event

Event Queue - site event, circle event (prioritzed on y-coord)
